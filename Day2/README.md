# Day 2: Environment Setup

Installing Rust with rustup
Open your terminal in Ubuntu on WSL.

If you haven't already installed rustup, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
This command will download and run the rustup-init script, which installs Rust and cargo for managing Rust projects.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once the installation is complete, Rust and cargo should be available in your terminal. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash

rustc --version
cargo --version
```
Understanding Cargo
Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It helps you manage dependencies, build your projects, run tests, and more.

To create a new Rust project using Cargo, navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run:

```bash
cargo new my_project_name
```
Replace `my_project_name` with the desired name of your project. This command will create a new directory with the project structure and necessary files.

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:
```bash

cd my_project_name
```
You can use cargo commands to build, run, test, and manage your project. 

For example:
* To build your project, run:
```bash
cargo build
```
* To run your project, run:
```bash
cargo run
```
* To run tests for your project, run:
```bash
cargo test
```

Additionally, Cargo manages dependencies for your project through the Cargo.toml file, which is located in the root directory of your project. 

You can add dependencies to this file, and Cargo will automatically download and manage them for you.

Action:
Open your terminal and create a new Rust project named hello_cargo using Cargo:
```bash
cargo new hello_cargo --bin
```
* This command creates a new Rust binary project named hello_cargo.

Navigate into the hello_cargo directory:
```bash
cd hello_cargo
```
Open the src/main.rs file in your text editor and you'll see the default Rust code generated by Cargo.

Modify the main.rs file to print "Hello, Cargo!" to the console:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Cargo!");
}
```
Save the file.
* Build and run your project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```
* You should see Hello, Cargo! printed to the console.

Congratulations! You've set up your Rust environment using rustup and learned the basics of Cargo. Day3, we'll dive deeper into basic Rust syntax and concepts.
