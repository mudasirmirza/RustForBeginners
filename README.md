# Rust for Beginners

As I start my journey of learning Rust, I will try to document everything as a beginner. I will be sharing all my code with examples and descriptions to make it easy for beginners to start learning Rust.

Learning Rust as a complete beginner is an exciting journey for me. Rust is known for its safety, speed, and concurrency capabilities. Over the next 30 days, I will try to break down the learning process into manageable pieces, with a focus on building a strong foundation and progressively tackling more complex topics. Here's a detailed plan to guide you through learning Rust from scratch.

## Week 1: Basics and Environment Setup

### Day 1: Introduction to Rust
* Concepts: What is Rust? Why Rust?
* Action: Read the introduction section of "The Rust Programming Language" book (available online for free).

### Day 2: Environment Setup
* Concepts: Installing Rust with rustup, understanding Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.
* Action: Install Rust, write your first program using cargo new and run it with cargo run.

### Day 3: Basic Syntax and Hello World
* Concepts: Basic syntax, comments, variables, and data types.
* Action: Write a simple program that prints "Hello, world!" and another program that uses variables.

### Day 4: Control Flow
* Concepts: if statements, loops (loop, while, for).
* Action: Write a program that uses if statements to check conditions, and another program that prints numbers 1 to 10 using a loop.

### Day 5: Functions
* Concepts: Defining functions, parameters, return values.
* Action: Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum.

### Day 6: Ownership and Borrowing
* Concepts: Ownership rules, borrowing, and slices.
* Action: Experiment with ownership and functions, try passing variables to functions and see how ownership works.

### Day 7: Structs and Enums
* Concepts: Defining and using structs, enums.
* Action: Define a struct to hold a person's name and age, and use it in a program.

## Week 2: Moving Beyond Basics

### Day 8: Match Statements and Error Handling
* Concepts: Using match for control flow, basics of error handling.
* Action: Write a program that uses a match statement to handle different Option values.

### Day 9: Collections
* Concepts: Vectors, strings, and hash maps.
* Action: Create a vector of integers, manipulate it (add, remove, access elements), and iterate over it.

### Day 10: Modules and Packages
* Concepts: Organizing code with modules, using packages.
* Action: Organize a project into modules, use an external package.

### Day 11: Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes
* Concepts: Generic data types, traits for shared behavior, lifetimes for references.
* Action: Write a function that takes a generic parameter, implement a trait for a struct.

### Day 12: Testing
* Concepts: Writing tests, running tests.
* Action: Write unit tests for a simple function, learn to run tests with cargo test.

### Day 13: File I/O
* Concepts: Reading from and writing to files.
* Action: Write a program that reads a file and prints its contents to the console.

### Day 14: Project Day
* Concept: Apply what you've learned.
* Action: Start a simple project, such as a command-line tool or a basic web server.

## Week 3: Intermediate Concepts

### Day 15-21: Diving Deeper
* Topics: Concurrency, async programming, advanced error handling, macros, advanced types (like Cell, RefCell, Rc, Arc, etc.).
* Action: Each day, pick one topic, read about it in "The Rust Programming Language" book or Rust documentation, and try to implement a small example.

## Week 4: Real-World Projects and Exploration

### Day 22-30: Building a Project
* Action: Spend the last week building a more substantial project. This could be anything from a web application using the Rocket or Actix framework, a command-line tool that interacts with APIs, or even a small game.
* Tips: Plan your project, break it down into small tasks, and tackle them one by one. Use online resources and Rust communities (like the Rust subreddit, Rust user forums, or the official Rust Discord) to seek help and feedback.

## Resources
* "The Rust Programming Language" book (also known as "The Book").
* Rust By Example (online resource with examples).
* Rustlings (small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code).
* Official Rust documentation and the API guidelines.

## Final Tips
* Practice is key. Try to code daily, even if it's just small exercises.
* Don't be afraid
